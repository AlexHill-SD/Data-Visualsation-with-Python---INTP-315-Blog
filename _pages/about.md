My name is Alex Hill, I'm currently a 4<sup>th</sup> semester student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT), in their Information Technology - Software Development diploma program. Alex’s knowledge of object-oriented programming languages, along with database-based backend systems has expanded greatly since my time as a Business Analyst with experience working on large scale multi-national projects throughout Central Europe, with a focus on Data preparation and Data Analytics. 

Past experiences include working on a long term Swiss banking project using SQL, SSIS, SSRS, to facilitate multiple projects’ data needs, accustomed to dealing with rapidly changing requirements and expectations.

I started my education in the United Kingdom, completing secondary education in Estonia and Poland. Returned to the United Kingdom to pursue a degree at Sheffield Hallam University before leaving to pursue the opportunity to work at Deloitte in the Czech Republic.

This unique experience has provided an insight into how to deal with culturally diverse projects and teams, furthered by my work on financial projects in Switzerland and Slovenia during my time at Deloitte.

I'm passionate about furthering my understanding of the complex data needs of companies and their clients, presenting the best tools and practices to transform a clients raw data into easy to use information packages, so as to allow projects to stay on time and budget while increase efficiency.
