# The importance of data visualisation
In today's data driven world, the importance of being able to easily convey the patterns, or trends, hidden within a dataset is one of the most vital abilities a developer can have.

For example, say as a developer we have a large dataset that describes the locality of our platforms users. If our platform has a total of 10 million users then the dataset in its raw form, whether it be csv, spreadsheet, database tables, etc, will be nearly impossible to understand at a glance. However, with the power of data visualisation tools like matplotlib and plotly, just to name a couple, we can display the raw data in a format that is easily understandle to our target audience.

Continuing the example above, there are a number of ways that we could display this data in a visual format that would allow for the easy identifcation of where our biggest userbase is located. Histograms, a heat map overlayed onto a world map, pie charts, these are all different methods that would allow even a casual observor to figure out which country has the highest proportion of users.
